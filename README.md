Roblox Portfolio:

Basic Info:
I've been scripting on roblox ever since Covid hit back in early 2020. I got my start doing commissions for developers and making scripting projects.
My timezone is UTC+10 and I live in Queensland, Australia.

Knowledge:
I'm familiar with these computer languages Python, C++, C#, Lua/LuaU, some X86ASM, and GDScript.
I'm familiar with many programming concepts, such as OOP->Abstraction->Encapsulation->Inheritance->Polymorphism->Composition, Functional programming, etc.
I'm currently learning reverse engineering with IDA Pro, OllyDBG, x64/32dbg, and other reverse engineering tools. 

I usually program using the OOP programming paradigm, with composition over inheritance.

My projects:
I have worked on many projects such as:

Perlin Noise Algorithm for Procedural Generation.
