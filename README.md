# Roblox Portfolio:


## Basic Info:
I've been scripting on roblox ever since Covid started back in early 2020, I learned by doing commissions for developers and making scripting projects.

My timezone is UTC+10 and I live in Queensland, Australia.

I primarily use Discord to communicate, however I'm open to other platforms such as TeamSpeak or Skype.


## Knowledge:

### Computer Languages
  I'm familiar with these computer languages:

  - Python
  - C#
  - Lua/LuaU
  - some X86ASM
  - GDScript.


  I'm also familiar with OOP, Composition and functional programming.
  
### Optimisation

Due to my vast experience with a variety of languages, from low level languages, to high level languages, I know how computers work, and therefore how to write optimised code.


## My projects:
I have worked on many projects such as:

### "HoverPrompt" Class:
