Roblox Portfolio:


Basic Info:
I've been scripting on roblox ever since Covid hit back in early 2020. I got my start doing commissions for developers and making scripting projects.
My timezone is UTC+10 and I live in Queensland, Australia.


Knowledge:
I'm familiar with these computer languages Python, C++, C#, Lua/LuaU, some X86ASM, and GDScript.
I'm familiar with many programming concepts, such as OOP ->Abstraction ->Encapsulation ->Inheritance ->Polymorphism ->Composition, Functional programming, etc.
I'm currently learning reverse engineering with IDA Pro, OllyDBG, x64/32dbg, and other reverse engineering tools. 

I usually program using the OOP programming paradigm, with composition over inheritance.
Due to my experience with reverse engineering and low level languages, such as C++ and X86ASM. I know how computers work, and therefore how to write optimised code.



Other knowledge: -> I don't do any commissions for these, and I'm not an expert in any of these fields.
I also know how to use blender to model, animate, and rig models.
I also know aspects of game design.


My projects:
I have worked on many projects such as:

Perlin Noise Algorithm for Procedural Generation.
