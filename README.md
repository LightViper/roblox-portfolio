# Roblox Portfolio:


## Basic Info:
I've been scripting on roblox ever since Covid started back in early 2020, I learned by doing commissions for developers and making scripting projects.

My timezone is UTC+10 and I live in Queensland, Australia.

I primarily use Discord to communicate, however I'm open to other platforms such as TeamSpeak or Skype.


## Knowledge:

### Computer Languages
  I'm familiar with these computer languages:

  - Python
  - C#
  - Lua/LuaU
  - some X86ASM
  - GDScript.


### Programming Concepts
  I'm familiar with these programming concepts:

  - OOP
  - Abstraction 
  - Inheritance 
  - Composition
  - Functional programming, etc.

I prefer using OOP, with composition over inheritance.

### Optimisation

Due to my vast experience with a variety of languages, from low level languages, to high level languages, I know how computers work, and therefore how to write optimised code.


## Other knowledge: -> I don't do any commissions for these, and I'm not an expert in any of these fields.

I know how to use blender to model, animate, and rig models.

I know how to use FL studio and basic music theory.

I know aspects of game design.

## My projects:
I have worked on many projects such as:
